README

This is my code that I'm writing just for fun. I barely know what I'm doing. It's probably broken in lots of ways so use at your own risk. Beware!

Processor Requirements:
Raspberry Pi
Xbee radio connected to Raspberry Pi UART
USB2AX connected via USB
WiringPi library
Dynamixel SDK library

Robot Requirements:
Trossen Robotics MkII PhantomX Hexapod chassis kit
Robotis Dynamixel AX-12A servos
Arbotix Commander controller

Features:
Real time IK/FK engine with tripod gait and wave gait

Installation:
Simply run 'make' to compile binary.

How to use:
Upon power up, just run 'runBETH'. Make sure the Xbee UART and USB2AX initialize properly via the terminal output.

Three buttons above left joystick:
#1 sets to Tripod Gait
#2 sets to Wave Gait

Three buttons above right joystick:
#1 sets to body rotation demo mode (feet stay planted and body rotates about X,Y,Z using joysticks)
#2 sets to body translation demo mode (feet stay planted and body translates X,Y,Z using joysticks)
#3 sets to default walk mode (left joystick walks forward/backward and straffes, right joystick rotates)

Shutdown:
You don't really have to, but if you want to shutdown nice and clean, press the two top buttons at the same time. You'll see a shutdown message on the terminal, the servos will go limp, and the program will end.
